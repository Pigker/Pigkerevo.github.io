## Overview

1. We needed to design a robot independently that could walk without using wheels. Therefore, I decided to design a bipedal robot to simulate human walking.
2. I started by sketching the basic shape of the robot. Then, I created a CAD model and used 3D printing to manufacture one leg of the robot.
3. Using a Raspberry Pi, I tested basic code functionality and electronic wiring to ensure the system was working correctly.
4. Next, I assembled the entire robot and programmed it to perform simple walking movements, conducting initial gait tests.
5. I used MuJoCo for simulation and applied the hill-climbing algorithm to optimize the motor control parameters, aiming to improve the robot's walking speed and stability. However, since the motor control relied 
on sine functions, the optimization had some limitations

6. To overcome these limitations, I implemented reinforcement learning to find the optimal actions for maximizing the robot's walking speed. Due to the high computational demand and long training times of reinforcement learning, I was only able to find some relatively basic actions in the simulation. 


<!-- ## Mindmaps

Hugo Blox supports a Markdown extension for mindmaps.

With this open format, can even edit your mindmaps in other popular tools such as Obsidian.

Simply insert a Markdown code block labelled as `markmap` and optionally set the height of the mindmap as shown in the example below.

Mindmaps can be created by simply writing the items as a Markdown list within the `markmap` code block, indenting each item to create as many sub-levels as you need:

<div class="highlight">
<pre class="chroma">
<code>
```markmap {height="200px"}
- Hugo Modules
  - Hugo Blox
  - blox-plugins-netlify
  - blox-plugins-netlify-cms
  - blox-plugins-reveal
```
</code>
</pre>
</div>

renders as

```markmap {height="200px"}
- Hugo Modules
  - Hugo Blox
  - blox-plugins-netlify
  - blox-plugins-netlify-cms
  - blox-plugins-reveal
```

Anh here's a more advanced mindmap with formatting, code blocks, and math:

```

## Highlighting

<mark>Highlight</mark> important text with `mark`:

```html
<mark>Highlighted text</mark>
```

## Callouts

Use [callouts](https://docs.hugoblox.com/reference/markdown/#callouts) (aka _asides_, _hints_, or _alerts_) to draw attention to notes, tips, and warnings.

By wrapping a paragraph in `{{%/* callout note */%}} ... {{%/* /callout */%}}`, it will render as an aside.

```markdown
{{%/* callout note */%}}
A Markdown aside is useful for displaying notices, hints, or definitions to your readers.
{{%/* /callout */%}}
```

renders as

{{% callout note %}}
A Markdown aside is useful for displaying notices, hints, or definitions to your readers.
{{% /callout %}}

Or use the `warning` callout type so your readers don't miss critical details:

{{% callout warning %}}
A Markdown aside is useful for displaying notices, hints, or definitions to your readers.
{{% /callout %}}
